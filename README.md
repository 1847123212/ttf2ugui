ttf2ugui
========

This is a simple utility to convert TrueType fonts into uGUI compatible
structures. It reads font file, renders each character into bitmap
and outputs it as uGUI compatible C structure. 

Optionally it can display ascii art sample of font.

Please remember to respect font copyrights when converting.
